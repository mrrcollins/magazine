#GTIA Magazine

An experiment in digital publishing for vintage electronics. GTIA is a magazine for the computers and video game systems before 1989. 

# What's different?

GTIA will be a fairly automated digitally published magazine. Along with this automation is the facility for others to translate the articles into different languages. This is already set up in the repository, with each language for each issue in a folder. Only English for now though.

# Releases

Each issue will be [released on Github](https://github.com/gtia/magazine/releases). I have *Volume 0* online now, which is just some articles from [Zmag/A\zine](http://www.textfiles.com/magazines/ZNET/0001.txt). The current format is .epub, but I'll be added .mobi for Kindle people soon. And if anyone wants to write a viewer for their favorite computer, I can also put up a single Markdown file with all the articles. Publication is set for the first Tuesday of every month.

# Contributing
## Email

Send your articles to *submissions@gtia.com*, preferably in [Markdown format](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). Most formats are accepted, I'll just have to convert them. :-) If you are including pictures, create a folder with the same name as your article and link to the pictures in that folder. I'm still trying to figure out the best way of doing this, so if you have any ideas, [let me know!](mailto:goz@gtia.com). Also, try not to include any spaces in your filenames. Yes, it seems archaic, but I'm still working on the tools.

## Using Github

1. Fork the *magazine* repository
1. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
2. Add your article and accompanying files to the submissions directory.
2. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
3. Push to the branch (`git push origin -u my-new-feature`)
4. Create new Pull Request

## Translations

Feel free to translate any and all articles! They can be emailed or you can submit a pull request in Github. Create an *Issue* on the Github website when you begin a translation so that there isn't duplicate work.
