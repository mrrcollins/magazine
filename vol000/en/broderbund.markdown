# BRODERBUND STILL GROWING

*Broderbund Grows*

   The media broadly proclaimed that 1985 was a -dismal- year for 
the personal computer industry. Broderbund Software proved 
otherwise.  Bolstered by several top selling home productivity and 
educational packages, spearheaded by the phenomenonal bestseller, 
Print Shop, Broderbund doubled their sales to $20 million during 
1985.

   The December issue of Inc. magazine ranked Broderbund as the 
13th fastest-growing privately held compay in the United States. 
Microcomputer software distributors First Software and Softsel 
International also experienced rapid growth during 1985.
