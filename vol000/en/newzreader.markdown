# New Zreader v 1.4

*by Clinton Smith*

Well here it is.The new ZREAD program is here.Here are some of 
its new features.Make sure that your zmag files end with the txt 
extender or the  program won't load them.Just rename them with the txt 
extender and they will load fine.

You don't have to type ZZZ after every  22 lines and the 
file doesn't need a return at the end of a line.

You can go back a page at a time to reread things and then
go forward again or you can return to the index to read a new issue

There is a scrolling headline banner to highlight 
important news.To use this feature in your own article,have an 
uppercase X followed by a lowercase x,then type your message (It can be
up to 60 characters long.)followed by a return.If you read this doc. 
file on ZREAD14 the following will demonstrate the feature

If you have the QCOL80.OBJ program,you can use 
zread14 with 80 columns.
1.Turn on your computer
2.From Basic go to the DOS menu
3.Load QCOL80.OBJ with the load binary option
4.Return to cartridge (select B)
5.Load ZREAD14.BAS
6.(Change line 170 to-FOR T=1 TO 700-)
7.Run the program

If you have any comments
please leave me a message on windy 
city for me.
