# RUMOR HUMOR

*HO HO HEH HEH*

   This satirical product announcement by Albert Lew of 
ABACUS, was found recently in the San Francisco-area users group's 
newsletter:

   -Did you hear about the new $10 EPROM burner coming from Atari? 
Stick some 128K EPROMS in the blue  plastic slots, and pop into the 
toaster oven.  The docs  recommend that you think hard about what you
want burned,  (Commodore, Apple, 
and IBM are suggested topics) and pray.  If you are agnostic, you are
requested to  send more money to Atari until you get reasonable 
results.-
